# Automation-and-Video-Monitoring-using-Raspberry-Pi-and-DHT22
The main objective of this project is to develop an interface for video monitoring by using Raspberry Pi B architecture. This project deals with Raspberry Pi processor, temperature sensor DHT-22, Raspberry Pi camera or webcam. This report presents the detection of real-time temperature and current video of the monitored system. In the presented system, it is possible to read the data from any adaptable sensor and monitoring it using a web-enabled device (computer, phone) web browser jointly with real-time video of the desired device. It is having capability to monitoring variables and also makes a visible state of such equipment using video features. Python language is used with DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor. This last one is a popular sensor module used by hobbyists for implementing in a lot of IoT Projects. This sensor along with Raspberry Pi can also be used in: •	HVAC Systems •	Thermostats •	Home and Office Climate Control •	Weather Station
